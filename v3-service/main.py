"""
ATLAS V3 Pipeline Service — HTTP wrapper around the V3 benchmark pipeline.

Exposes the full V3 pipeline (PlanSearch, DivSampling, BudgetForcing,
PR-CoT, RefinementLoop, etc.) as an HTTP service that the Go proxy can
call for T2/T3 tasks.

Test cases are generated via SelfTestGen since we don't have benchmark
ground truth. The sandbox runs syntax/runtime checks on all candidates.

Streams progress events back as SSE for real-time feedback.

The pipeline itself lives in flat sibling modules: adapters.py (service
clients), scoring.py (candidate verification), symbols.py (tree-sitter
tooling), planning.py (/v3/plan), and pipeline.py (the orchestrator).
