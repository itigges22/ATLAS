"""CxGx candidate allocation — the probe's lens scores choose k.

One probe candidate is generated and scored by the Geometric Lens in a
single embedding extraction (`/internal/lens/gx-score`). Two signals come
back and both are used:

  C(x) normalized energy  picks a BASE tier on the lens's own per-model
                          calibrated scale (lower energy = easier task),
                          through budget_forcing.select_tier.
  G(x) quality score      ESCALATES that tier by +1 or +2 when the XGBoost
                          correctness classifier disagrees with C(x) —
                          i.e. when the probe looks cheap but wrong.

The tier then sets k through `TIER_MIN_K`, under a hard ``k >= 3`` floor.

Why the floor is the whole design. The C(x)-only predecessor had no floor
and measured +0.0 pp: its k tracked the lens's normalization convention
rather than the task, and it handed k=1 to 60% of tasks whose probe had
just FAILED the sandbox — it starved generation on exactly the tasks that
needed candidates. With the floor, the allocator can only ADD candidates
to today's pinned k=3, never remove them, so its worst case equals current
behavior. The G(x) escalation is what makes the added compute land on the
right tasks: at n=175/arm the gate measured 66.9% against 64.6% for fixed
k=3 and 61.7% for a shuffled-assignment arm carrying the SAME tier mix, so
5.1 pp of the gain comes from where the compute goes rather than how much
of it is spent.

Both orchestrators call `allocate()`: the bench runner (no wall-clock cap,
`remaining_ms=None`) and the live V3 service (capped by ATLAS_V3_TIMEOUT,
which passes its remaining budget so an escalation can never buy more
candidates than the clock can generate).
