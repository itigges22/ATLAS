"""Where a piece of evidence came from, and what it is about.

`contract.py` records how STRONG a verifier was. It does not record who the
verifier was, so a model-generated test that runs and a repository test that
runs produce the same `behavioral` record. Strength is not trust: the same
model wrote the code and the test, from the problem statement alone, and on
the captured pool 21 of 36 valid generated keys disagreed with the task's own
reference.

Two things live here, and in this build neither authorizes anything. Nothing
in production imports this module yet; wiring it into a delivery decision is a
separate change, because doing it here would alter what lands on disk.

  source   a closed, source-SPECIFIC vocabulary. Deliberately not a
           `trusted=true` boolean: a boolean cannot say that the proxy's own
           syntax gate may close a syntax obligation and may not close a
           behavioural one, which is exactly the distinction that decides
           whether a candidate may be delivered.

  binding  the identities the evidence is about -- candidate, request,
           invocation, command, obligation, and the workspace generation it
           was observed against. Evidence that cannot name them cannot be
           shown to be about them, and evidence about a workspace two
           mutations ago is about a workspace that no longer exists.

The hidden benchmark evaluator is absent by construction: there is no constant
for it and no constructor that can produce one, so production cannot name it
even by mistake. A test fails if such a name appears.

Nothing here holds candidate bytes. A binding carries hashes and identities;
the bytes stay where they already are.
