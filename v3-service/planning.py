# --- Plan generation (/v3/plan) ----------------------------------------------
#
# Generates a structured plan for an agent task. Reuses the same LLMAdapter
# the code-generation pipeline uses, but with a planning prompt template and
# a heuristic scorer (V3's lens-based scorer is for code embeddings, not prose
# plans, so it doesn't apply here).
#
# Why bother: when a compact coding model gets a multi-step task without a plan, it
# wanders through 12+ turns of recon before any real work. Forcing the
# model to commit to an ordered set of steps up front cuts the wander to
# zero — even a wrong plan beats no plan, because at least the wrongness
# is visible in one screen instead of buried in a trace.

PLAN_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an architect. Output ONLY a JSON plan, no other text. No markdown fences. No prose preamble.

User goal: {user_message}
Working directory: {working_dir}

{project_context}

Produce a plan as a SINGLE JSON object:
{{
  "steps": [
    {{"id": "s1", "action": "<concrete action>", "target": "<file path or url>", "why": "<one short sentence>"}},
    ...
  ],
  "verify_step": "<id of the step that verifies the fix works>",
  "rationale": "<one sentence on why this plan shape is right>"
}}

Rules:
- Each step is a single tool call: read_file, write_file, edit_file, structural_edit, delete_file, run_command, list_directory.
- Tool selection guidance:
    * read_file        — inspect a file before editing it
    * write_file       — create a NEW file (rejected for files >5 lines that already exist)
    * edit_file        — small, targeted string change (one function, one block) inside an existing file
    * structural_edit         — replace a WHOLE function, class, or HTML element by selector. Use for any
                         "replace the dashboard function" / "rewrite <body>" / "swap the validate method"
                         step. Selectors: `function:NAME`, `class:NAME`, `<tag>` (.py and .html only).
                         Strongly preferred over edit_file when the change is a whole-unit swap —
                         edit_file truncates on long old_str/new_str pairs (>1.5 KB hits max_tokens
                         mid-string and the JSON parse fails). structural_edit takes no old_str so it
                         doesn't truncate.
    * run_command      — build, test, run, curl. Verifies behavior.
    * delete_file      — remove a file
    * list_directory   — list a directory's contents
- The verify_step MUST run a verification command — curl, pytest, python <script>, go test, npm test, cargo test, make test. ls / cat / grep do NOT verify; they only inspect.
- Minimum 2 steps, maximum 6. Tighter is better.
- Address the user's STATED problem only. Don't add unrelated work, don't re-architect.
- For "fix" intents, the plan shape should be: investigate (1 step) → change (1-3 steps) → verify (1 step).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Deterministic plan normalisation
#
# Audited on the literal prompt "Build me a snake game.", the planner produced:
#   s1 write_file index.html | s2 write_file game.js | s3 write_file style.css
#   s4 edit_file  index.html  "Link the CSS and JS files to the HTML document."
#   s5 run_command "python3 -m http.server 8000"   <- verify_step
#
# Two defects, both deterministic and both fixable without a model call:
#
#   * s4 manufactures an edit. index.html is greenfield in this same plan, and
#     the CSS/JS paths are known at planning time, so the links belong in s1's
#     initial write. The split creates an exact-span edit for a quantized model
#     that measurably cannot perform them -- one dogfood session died looping
#     on precisely this edit_file/index.html pair.
#   * s5 is setup, not verification. Starting a server proves the server
#     starts; it cannot fail when the application is inert. The plan prompt
#     invites this by listing `curl` as a valid verification command, and a
#     session duly shipped a broken game as "verified" off `curl -I`.
#
# Normalisation runs before scoring so a plan cannot win on structure it only
# has because it split a file write in two.
