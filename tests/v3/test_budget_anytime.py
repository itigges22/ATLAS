"""V3 hands back its best candidate when its clock runs out.

V3 is an anytime algorithm: the refinement loop is budget-gated, so it expands
to fill ATLAS_V3_TIMEOUT rather than converging early. Measured 2026-08-03 on
one task — a 180s budget produced 9 LLM calls and 5 sandbox verifications, a
420s budget 21 calls and 10. The cap is its terminal condition, not an
interruption.

It returned nothing at that terminal condition. The caller's deadline
cancelled the request, every verified candidate went with it, and the write
fell back to the model's own output: 16 of 41 write calls in one 28-session
run, ~48 of the 56 minutes spent in them.
