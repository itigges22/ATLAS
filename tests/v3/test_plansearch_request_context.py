"""PlanSearch worker threads and the request context they dispatch under.

PlanSearch is the only V3 stage that sends inference from worker threads. A
thread inherits neither the request thread's ContextVars nor its locals, so
every request-scoped value PlanSearch needs has to reach it some other way.
When the outbound call's identity did not, the calls went out unattributed:
against a permissive upstream that is a silently missing correlation ID, and
against one that enforces attribution it is an HTTP 403 per call.

Measured 2026-08-23, 42-case acquisition: all 14 PlanSearch invocations
returned 0 candidates, all 28 worker calls refused, and nothing raised --
DivSampling filled the slots and the stage read as alive but unproductive.
These tests use a real enforcing upstream over real sockets, because that
distinction is exactly what an in-process double erases.
