"""Every background-execution site in the services is classified, on purpose.

A worker thread inherits none of its parent's request context: not the
request-ID ContextVar, not the request's locals. Anything request-scoped it
needs has to be handed to it explicitly. The one site that forgot cost a
complete 42-case acquisition -- PlanSearch's fan-out sent 28 unattributed
inference calls, an attribution-enforcing upstream refused all of them, and
the stage reported an empty candidate list rather than an error.

This is the structural half of that fix. The behavioural half lives in
test_plansearch_request_context.py; this one makes sure the next background
worker cannot be added without someone stating which of the three cases it
is. It fails on an unlisted site, not on a wrong one -- the classification
is a review artifact, and the test's job is to force the review.
