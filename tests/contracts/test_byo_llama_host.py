"""Pointing ATLAS at a host-native llama-server must work on Linux too.

GH #146: the documented recipe uses `host.docker.internal`, which is a Docker
Desktop convenience and does not resolve on stock Linux Docker. Users had to
reverse-engineer the docker0 gateway (172.17.0.1) themselves. Mapping the same
hostname via host-gateway makes one override serve every platform.
