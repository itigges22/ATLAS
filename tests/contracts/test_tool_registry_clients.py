"""Clients that enumerate tool names must not drift from the proxy registry.

The VS Code extension shipped listing `ast_edit` for two weeks after the
proxy renamed it to `structural_edit`, and never learned about
`insert_after`. Nothing failed: the diff preview silently did nothing on
the two tools that edit code in place, which is the feature. A rename in
Go cannot break a string in TypeScript, so only a check that reads both
catches it.

This asserts the *edit* tools specifically. A client is free to ignore
read-only tools (read_file, search_files); what it must not do is claim to
preview file edits and then miss one.
