"""The deployment's memory maxima have to fit the machine.

A per-command ceiling stops one runaway command. It does not stop a deployment
whose configured maxima exceed the host: the sandbox was allowed eleven
gigabytes on a fifteen-gigabyte host where the inference server held nine with
no limit at all, so every process was inside its own bounds at the moment the
kernel went looking for something to kill.

These read docker-compose.yml as written. Nothing is applied and no container
is started.
