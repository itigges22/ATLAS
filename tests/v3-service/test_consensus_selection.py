"""Agreement, not the model's guess, decides when the answer key is wrong.

The self-test compares a candidate's output to an expected value the same
model produced. For a task it cannot reliably solve, producing the answer IS
the task, so the key is wrong and correct code fails its own suite.

Measured in one run: 42 self-test verifications, every one 0/N, and V3
selected a candidate in 0 of 12 sessions — every session shipped the model's
own draft. A candidate pulled from those logs passed immediately when given a
correct expected value, so the code was never the problem.

CodeT (Chen et al., 2022), already cited for this pipeline, does not use
generated tests as an oracle. It runs candidates on the generated INPUTS and
clusters them by agreement. These tests pin that behaviour.
