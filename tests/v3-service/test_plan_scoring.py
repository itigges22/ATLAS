# Measured on aoc_sonar: the winning plan's step 1 was `write_file input.txt`
# — "create the necessary input data" — against a 2000-line fixture already on
# disk. The model tried to retype it from memory, degenerated into repeating
# one line, had its stream cut mid-JSON, and the run died on three unparseable
# responses. aoc_course executed the same step successfully and corrupted the
# fixture. Both plans scored 1.00, because nothing looked at what was there.
