"""An adapter may declare only what it can actually evaluate.

Three declarations used to be derived rather than made:

  supported     inferred from set membership, so an adapter became
                "supported" for an artifact class by not being listed anywhere;
  requirements  built FROM capabilities -- literally
                `[requirement(c) for c in _CAPABILITIES[adapter]]` -- so an
                adapter invented the task's obligations out of its own reach,
                which is the one thing contract.py's docstring says it must
                never do;
  evaluators    implicit in a branch of _observations, so "this adapter can
                measure X" and "something here computes X" were separate
                facts nothing compared.

The sealed Stage-A acquisition is what that cost: 100 of 103 candidate
evaluations ran under `python_compile`, which declares four BROWSER criteria
it cannot measure, and every one recorded
`missing_required: ["temporal_progress", "input_causality"]` with
`capabilities: []`. Closure was unreachable for every Python candidate in the
run -- not because the corpus lacked an oracle, but because no Python route
can reach it at all.

These tests pin the registry as a structure. They do NOT change what any
adapter reports: correcting the CONTENT of python_compile's declaration
necessarily moves records into contract.select's ineligible bucket, which
changes selection, and this commit must be authority-inert.
