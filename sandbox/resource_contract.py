"""One resource contract for every untrusted command this executor runs.

A staged verification command took the host down. `pilot_failing_range_step`
seeds a loop that appends without bound, its own failing test calls it, and its
client-declared verification is `python3 -m pytest -q test_steps.py`. pytest
reached 5.9 GB in seconds, the kernel ran a GLOBAL out-of-memory kill, and it
chose the largest resident process on the box -- the inference server, which had
no cgroup limit and 7.6 GB resident. The executor bounded TIME at sixty seconds
per command and nothing else, so the time bound never got a chance.

Two things were missing, and only one of them is a limit.

The first is a memory ceiling that covers the whole descendant tree. The second
is a truthful answer. RLIMIT_AS alone gives the wrong one: a python process that
hits it raises MemoryError and exits 1, which is byte-for-byte what a failing
test looks like. A verification that never completed would then be recorded as a
behavioural failure of the candidate -- the machine asserting something it did
not observe. So the ceiling is enforced twice: a kernel rlimit as a hard
backstop, and a sampler that watches the process group's own resident set and
kills it deliberately, because a limit WE applied is a fact we can report.

Nothing here decides anything about a candidate. It reports how an execution
ended; whether that ending can support evidence is the proxy's decision, and
every non-`completed` outcome is defined so that it cannot.
