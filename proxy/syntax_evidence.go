//
// The typed provenance envelope has existed since af94b75 with no producer:
// it could describe where evidence came from, and nothing came from anywhere.
// This file is the first producer, and it is deliberately the weakest one.
//
// What it attests is exactly what ATLAS's own structural gate already
// evaluated -- the same fallbackSyntaxOutcomeFor every write goes through, not
// a second checker with its own opinion. What it may therefore close is one
// kind of obligation, at one strength: structural validity, at syntax. It
// cannot be talked into anything above that, because the ceiling is on the
// SOURCE and not on the record: proxy_owned_validation's ceiling is syntax in
// provenanceCeiling, so even a forged observed strength cannot raise it.
//
// Nothing consumes what this produces. authorizedV3Replacement, the write
// path, the ledger join and terminal completion are unchanged; a structural
// guard enumerates every production consumer of provenance and fails when the
// delivery graph gains one.

// proxyEvidence is one observation the proxy made about one candidate, bound
// to everything needed to say what it is about.
//
// Outcome and authority are separate on purpose. A structural failure is a
// real, bound observation -- it is how a caller knows the bytes were looked at
// and rejected -- and it authorizes nothing. Collapsing the two would make
// "we checked and it failed" indistinguishable from "we never looked".
