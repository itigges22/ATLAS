// obligations.go decided WHOSE list a run owes -- the caller's or the
// heuristic's. It says nothing about what sort of thing each item is or how
// strongly it must be shown, so a path and a command arrived as the same
// untyped string and any evidence about either looked equally good.
//

//
//	KIND      what sort of thing is owed (a closed set)
//	STRENGTH  how strong the evidence closing it must be
//	SUBJECT   the exact thing it is owed about, carried as a hash
//
// The subject is a hash and never the text. A declared verification command
// is a subject, and a command string in an operator log is a content leak; a
// uniform rule that never carries text cannot leak one by exception.
//
// The same vocabulary exists in v3-service/obligations.py. Two copies of a
// closed set is a divergence waiting to happen, so a contract test parses
// both and fails when they disagree.

// artifact_exists was a required obligation with a syntax floor; nothing can
// evidence a file's existence before the candidate lands; delivery needs
// authorization; authorization needed the obligation met. The task was
// unsatisfiable by construction, and the loop was invisible because every
// piece of it looked reasonable on its own.
//
// The fix is a typed distinction rather than a special case at the one site
// that noticed. Three roles, and every kind has exactly one:
//
//	target_identity              names WHICH artifact a delivery may replace.
//	                             It is the client saying "this path is mine to
//	                             hand you". It is never evidence about bytes.
//	authorization_prerequisite   must be satisfied, by evidence bound to the
//	                             exact candidate, BEFORE those bytes may land.
//	post_delivery_settlement     can only be answered after the bytes are on
//	                             disk and the ledger agrees they are there.
//
// artifact_exists carries the first and the third and neither of the second:
// a declared path authorizes a target and settles afterwards, and at no point
// does "the client asked for this path" say the bytes are any good.
