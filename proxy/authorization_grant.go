// Turning an authorized decision into something that can be spent exactly once.
//
// A decision is a statement about a moment: these bytes, this candidate, this
// workspace, and every obligation the client stated satisfied by evidence that
// binds. It is not a licence. Between deciding and writing, the workspace can
// move, the same candidate can be offered again, the request can be cancelled,
// and two goroutines can arrive at the same conclusion at once -- and a
// decision that is merely TRUE is true every one of those times.
//
// A grant is the decision made spendable. It carries the identities the
// decision was about, it is consumed atomically at one owner, and a second
// attempt gets nothing. That is the whole difference between "these bytes were
// authorized" and "these bytes may land now".
//
// Three separations the vocabulary keeps: selection does not imply
// authorization -- V3 picking a winner says nothing about whether the client's
// obligations are met; authorization does not imply delivery -- a grant can be
// minted and never spent; and consumption never re-decides -- it validates what
// the grant was bound to and refuses, because a decision recomputed under new
// state is a different decision wearing the old one's identity.

// grantCapacity bounds how many live grants one request may hold.
//
// A request delivers a handful of artifacts. A number far above that is a
// runaway, and the honest response to a runaway is to refuse before mutating
// rather than to grow.
