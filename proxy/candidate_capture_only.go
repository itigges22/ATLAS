// An acquisition control, not a policy mode.
//
// An outcome-blind eligibility or calibration acquisition has one invariant
// that outranks everything it is trying to measure: candidate bytes must never
// enter the active task workspace. A delivered candidate changes what the model
// sees next, how many routes the task takes, which terminal it reaches and what
// evidence exists by the end -- and it does all of that whether or not anyone
// runs an evaluator afterwards. The first pilot delivered two candidates under
// STRICT authorization and the run's own report called the mechanism layer
// clean, because the gate it wrote only forbade an ADVISORY delivery. The
// distinction does not repair the violation.
//
// So this suppresses the delivery and keeps the reason. It is deliberately NOT
// a fourth product mode: strict, advisory and automatic_v3 are what a client
// may ask for, they are unchanged, and no experiment gets to redefine them.
// This is an operator-owned switch on a private experimental process, default
// off, and nothing a client, a model, a service or a task contract sends can
// reach it.

// CandidateCaptureOnlyEnv is the one place the control is read from. An
// environment variable on the process an operator started: not a request field,
// not a contract field, not a header, and not anything the pipeline returns.

// that may not deliver.

// Fails closed to ordinary behaviour. An unset, empty, unknown or malformed
// value is "off", because the value that would be dangerous to get wrong is the
// one that silently stops deliveries in production -- and the value that would
// be dangerous to guess is one that quietly enables an experiment. Neither
// happens: only the exact affirmative spellings enable it.
