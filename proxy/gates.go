// Gates: the checks the agent loop runs at its decision points — before a
// write reaches disk, and before a `done` is accepted.
//
// In file order:
//
//	Completion-claim verification — bounces a `done` whose summary claims
//	  universal success ("all routes work") while the workspace still shows
//	  a structural gap. Needs both halves, so a narrow summary or a clean
//	  workspace passes untouched.
//	Structural-unresolved gate — asks v3-service whether a write or edit
//	  leaves an undefined name behind, and rejects only the unresolved names
//	  that this change introduced.
//	Syntax gate — routes fallback writes through the sandbox's
//	  /syntax-check. These are the writes that skipped the V3 pipeline, so
//	  nothing else in the loop has parsed them.
//	Embedded-script gate — parses the JS/CSS inside <script>/<style> blocks
//	  in HTML files and in Python string literals, which every other gate is
//	  structurally blind to.
//	Plan adherence — matches each tool call against the pre-flight plan and
//	  counts the off-plan streak, regenerating the plan once the streak runs
//	  long. Advisory: it never blocks a call.
//	Plan-progress reminder — renders the compact step-progress block
//	  injected ahead of each LLM call so a long multi-file task doesn't
//	  lose track of what's left.
//	Asset-graph lint — cross-file coherence for small web projects: a
//	  template no route renders, an href to a file that isn't there, a fetch
//	  to a route that doesn't exist. Advisory notes, deduped per session.
//
// They share a shape, not a subject. Each one inspects agent output or the
// workspace at a single point in the loop and returns a string; the blocking
// four return it as a rejection the model must answer, the advisory three
// return it as a [system note]. They hold no state in common — this is a
// policy surface, not a pipeline, and gates can be read and changed one at a
// time.

// Completion-claim verification.

// Background: the agent's done.summary often makes universal claims
// ("all routes work", "fixed all bugs", "verified everything") that
// we can structurally check against the workspace. The May 2026 flask
// run had the model claim "All routes are functioning properly" while
// only 3 of 7 needed templates existed. The verification gate only
// checks "did you run a verification command at all?" — it does
// NOT check whether the claim in the summary matches reality.
//
// Two-stage filter:
//   1. claimsUniversal(summary) — does the wording make a global
//      assertion? Quiet pass for narrow done summaries ("added /admin
//      route" — model said nothing about the rest of the app).
//   2. verifyCompletionClaims(workingDir) — cheap structural
//      checks for the failure modes we know about. Returns a directive
//      to the model when a gap is found, "" otherwise.
//
// Conservative on false positives. Universal claims with no gap pass
// silently; narrow claims pass even when there ARE gaps elsewhere.
// Only the AND case (claim + gap) bounces. The model can override by
// using narrower wording or by calling out the gap explicitly.

// multiIssueWords trips when the USER PROMPT (not the summary) signals
// "fix multiple things." Models bypass claimsUniversal by writing a

// clearly asked for the whole app to work. Catching it on the prompt

// Plan adherence — track tool calls against the pre-flight plan
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Adherence is advisory by default: we record which planned steps a tool
// call satisfies and emit metric events, but we don't block the model.
// Hard-blocking off-plan calls would be brittle when the plan was
// suboptimal — the model often discovers correct work the planner
// missed.
//
// What we DO actively do: count the off-plan streak, and once it
// crosses planAutoReviseThreshold we regenerate the plan with whatever
// context the agent has discovered so far. That's the "plan_revise
// escape" — the agent doesn't have to know about a plan_revise tool;
// the loop notices the divergence and re-plans for it.
//
// Adherence rules:
//   - A tool call satisfies the FIRST unsatisfied plan step whose
//     action verb matches the tool name (read_file ↔ "read_file" or
//     "read", run_command ↔ "run_command" or "run").
//   - If the planned step has a target, we additionally require the
//     tool's path/command to mention that target. Loose substring
//     match — paths normalize to basename so /workspace/app.py and
//     ./app.py both match a step targeting "app.py".
//   - Steps are matched in order (first unsatisfied wins) so the
//     model can revisit a planned action without re-satisfying earlier
//     steps. Out-of-order is fine; off-plan is what we count.
