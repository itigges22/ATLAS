// Whether the exact candidate V3 selected may land automatically.
//
// Strict asks a question that a request declaring no verification cannot
// answer: does trusted evidence meet the floor the client declared. There is
// no floor, so the honest answer was to keep the model's own bytes -- and a
// pipeline that generates K candidates, ranks them and picks a winner never
// reached the artifact at all. That is not a safety property, it is an
// evidence property, and the two were being conflated.
//
// automatic_v3 separates them. The evidence question keeps its honest answer:
// nothing here claims the candidate is correct, and no score, consensus, Lens
// value or service verdict is consulted. What is checked is everything that
// was never about evidence in the first place -- that these are the exact
// bytes the selection path named, over a target the client declared, inside
// the mutation scope its own tool call defined, on a workspace nothing has
// moved underneath, with syntax intact and no declared check failed. Those
// hold or they do not, and they are the same requirements a strict delivery
// has always had to satisfy on top of its evidence.
//
// The user's involvement does not change: the ordinary permission prompts
// still gate dangerous tools, deletion keeps its exact-object approval, and
// what lands is reviewed as a diff. Nothing here asks anyone to adjudicate a
// candidate, because the competition is internal and always was.

// grantBasis is why a licence was minted. It is recorded on the grant, so a
// later reader can tell a delivery that satisfied a declared floor from one
// that satisfied the safety requirements and had no floor to satisfy.
