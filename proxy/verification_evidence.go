// Evidence that a command the CLIENT required ran, and what it ran against.
//
// This is the second producer and the first that can reach behavioral
// strength. Its whole claim is narrow: a command the validated request named,
// executed exactly as the client wrote it, exiting successfully against an
// isolated workspace that held these exact candidate bytes and was left
// unchanged by the run.
//
// It executes nothing. Staging runs the command, through the sandbox the rest
// of the system already uses and the safety check the model's own commands go
// through; a producer that ran commands of its own would be a second execution
// route with a second set of rules. What it consumes is the observation
// staging brings back: hashes either side, an exit status and a closed
// outcome, with no command text and no output attached.
//
// Three things it deliberately cannot do:
//
//   - upgrade a model's command. Authority comes from the DECLARATION, not
//     from the text. A command the client never declared has no obligation, so
//     there is nothing for a matching string to attach to.
//   - prove something about an unrelated artifact. A run that named nothing
//     covers nothing, and one that named other files covers those.
//   - close anything but the one command it is about. Two declared commands
//     are two obligations; one passing leaves the other owed.
//
// Nothing consumes what this produces: the record goes to private telemetry,
// and no delivery, completion or generation decision reads it.

// verificationEvidenceRequest is one declared command, one staged run of it,
// and the candidate it is claimed to be about.
