// Running a client's declared commands against a candidate, in a workspace
// that is not the user's.
//
// This builds no second executor. The sandbox already snapshots the workspace,
// overlays files, runs a command in the copy and deletes it in a `finally` --
// that is the mechanism V3 build verification has used all along, and a second
// one would be a second set of safety rules to keep in step. What this adds is
// the part that was missing: materialising the exact candidate at the exact
// target, asking the executor what the workspace looked like either side of
// each command, and refusing every result that cannot be shown to be about the
// bytes it claims.
//
// The production workspace is never written. Candidate bytes go into the
// overlay and nowhere else, which is what makes running a client's test safe
// before anything is delivered.

// stagingBackgroundRe recognises a command that would leave work running after
// it returns. A staged command must exit; one that forks into the background
// has not finished when we look, so whatever we observed is about a workspace
// something is still writing to.

//
//  1. the request is validated, including that the bytes are the candidate
//     the identity names;
//  2. the candidate is materialised at the canonical target inside the
//     isolated overlay, and nowhere else;
//  3. the staged target's hash is confirmed to equal the candidate hash
//     before anything runs;
//  4. each command goes through the existing safety check and the existing
//     sandbox path, with the existing cancellation and timeout controls;
//  5. the target and the workspace are re-hashed after every command;
//  6. anything that changed the candidate, changed an input, escaped, ran
//     long, backgrounded or could not be observed produces a refusal rather
//     than a pass;
//  7. the overlay is destroyed by the executor whatever happened.
//
// A set that cannot be run whole inside the budget is reported incomplete. It
// is never run in part and called finished.
