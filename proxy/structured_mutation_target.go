// A structured mutation target is the one path the model's own tool call
// named, read off that call's parsed arguments and nothing else.
//
// It exists for the interactive request. A person types into the TUI, the
// client declares work and, by explicit selection, automatic_v3 -- and it
// declares no expected outputs, because it knows nothing structured about
// which files the task requires and guessing them from the prose is the thing
// the contract replaces. Without a declared output there was no target for an
// automatic delivery to bind to, so the pipeline's selected candidate never
// reached the artifact for exactly the traffic it exists to serve.
//
// The model's write_file or edit call is a third thing, and it is structured
// rather than inferred: fields, not sentences. It names a canonical target and
// bounds a mutation, and under automatic_v3 that target may ground the delivery
// of the selected candidate to that exact path.
//
// What it is NOT, and structural tests pin each one:
//
//   - not a task obligation. It never becomes an expected output, never feeds
//     completion, never proves anything finished, and never says a file the
//     user asked for exists;
//   - not permission for any other path, any additional file, any deletion,
//     move, rename or command, and not a way past containment, deny lists,
//     protected assets, stale-baseline checks, permissions, mutation debt or
//     completion gates;
//   - not evidence. A candidate delivered on this ground is exactly as
//     unproven as it was, and every hard veto still applies;
//   - not available to strict or advisory, which keep their evidence question
//     and their answer, and not available to a question request, which can
//     create no mutation authority at all.
//
// The mutation scope owner derives the target (deriveMutationScope, from the
// parsed call); the authorization owner decides on it and the grant records
// what grounded the target. Nothing else reads it.

// What grounded a grant's target. Closed vocabulary, recorded on the grant and
// in telemetry; never a path and never prose.
