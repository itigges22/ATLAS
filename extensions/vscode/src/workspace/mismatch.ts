// Passive workspace-mismatch heuristic. The proxy applies file ops to its
// own bind-mounted workspace (ATLAS_WORKSPACE_DIR) and no endpoint exposes
// that path, so the extension cannot verify the mount directly. Instead:
// after a file-op tool_result reports success, wait a short settle delay,
// stat the target path inside the local workspace folder, and compare with
// a pre-op stat captured at tool_call time:
//
//   write_file  -> the file must exist (an overwrite with an unchanged
//                  mtime is inconclusive, not proof of a wrong mount)
//   edit_file / structural_edit -> the file must exist; unchanged mtime is
//                  inconclusive (coarse-mtime filesystems)
//   delete_file -> the file must be absent
//   move_file   -> destination present, source absent
//
// No probe writes, ever. A single 'mismatch' verdict is enough to warn
// once ("proxy likely mounted elsewhere"); 'inconclusive' verdicts are
// dropped silently — mtime granularity, unsaved editors, and absolute
// proxy-side paths make false positives too easy otherwise.
//
// Deliberately vscode-free (stat is injected) so it runs under plain vitest.
