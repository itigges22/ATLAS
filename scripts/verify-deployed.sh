# `docker compose build` produces a new image; it does NOT restart anything.
# A container started before that build keeps running the old code, and every
# subsequent measurement describes a build that is no longer the source tree.
# That has happened twice: a YAML-checker fix sat built-but-not-running for a
# full cycle, and earlier a proxy/sandbox mount split invalidated a day of
# results. Both were invisible because the containers were healthy — they were
# just healthy copies of the wrong thing.
